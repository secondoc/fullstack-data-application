      "<p>It feels like it was just a couple weeks ago that we here at the Report were thrilled about how few articles related to celebrity deaths there were on the Report, and that's because <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Top_25_Report/October_3_to_9,_2021\" title=\"Wikipedia:Top 25 Report/October 3 to 9, 2021\">it was</a>. Unfortunately, we can't have nice things for very long, as illustrated by how much of this week's Report is shaped up by new entries on the death list that hardly leaves (#7), with most of the shows and movies on the list also coincidentally focused on death. Just in time for spooky season, I guess.\n",
      "</p><p>At the very top of the list is finally something other than that one show (whose pageviews are slowly but surely dying) where hundreds of people die playing kids' games (#2). The death of the first African-American secretary of state and one of the architects of the <a href=\"/wiki/Iraq_War\" title=\"Iraq War\">Iraq War</a>, in which tons of soldiers and innocent civilians died, shot him right to number one on the Report. Elsewhere, a prop gun shot this widely-unknown cinematographer (#17) onto the Report and also in the chest, killing her after it was fired by a widely-known actor (#4). Her death was widely compared to the accidental shooting of a kind-of-widely-known-in-the-'90s actor (#5) and son of an entirely-known martial artist (#16), who died young as well.\n",
      "</p><p>We've also got the third season of a show about a budding serial killer (#6, #8, #20), the twelfth installment of a film series about a seasoned serial killer (#9), the twenty-fifth installment of a man with a license to kill (#12, #24) - whose villain (#25) brought life back to a comedy series... and in a sketch plays <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-N6ldD0H2k&amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive\" rel=\"nofollow\">a serial killer</a>! - plus a movie about an assassination (#14), superheroes who seemingly cannot die (#22), and how the Kanye we once knew has been put to pasture (#23). Don't fear the reaper, folks! At least there are non-morbid subjects in the North American release of <i>Dune</i> (#3, #10, #21), wrestling and cricket in Arabia (#11, #13, #15), and two musicians (#18, #19).\n",

After Adele released yet another critically acclaimed ballad in the form of \"Easy on Me\", the song broke streaming records and topped almost all of the charts that it appeared on this week. Meanwhile, her fourth studio album, 30, about her divorce and motherhood, is set to be released in less than a month and will also likely cause the world to stop.</td>\n",

He had a supporting role in the oft-forgotten sitcom The War at Home, appeared in the box office bomb Dolittle, and was kind of also in the rom-com Larry Crowne, a movie I didn't even know existed. I can't imagine how anyone could forget that he does comedy.  "

       "20  Holy Jewish space lasers, Batman!Representative Greene's (R-GA) support for an endless number of conspiracy theories isn't really news (see a WaPo article from last June.) However, it's gotten some more attention this week, as her support of QAnon (which she brought with her to the list, how sweet) grows more fervent, and some concerning social media activity of hers advocating for the murders of several Democratic leaders (Obama, Clinton, and Pelosi) came to light. A video in which she harnessed her Super Karen powers to follow and accost a visibly annoyed David Hogg (survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and anti-gun advocate who is 26 years Greene's junior) over his support of red flag laws and her ridiculous belief that he worked as a \"crisis actor\" as part of an effort to stage the shooting also gained renewed attention. Some Congress Democrats are calling for her expulsion, but it's unlikely they'll get the required support from the Republicans.  \n",

Well, as soon as you get to the 20s it's hard to remember it all: I know one of them ended Prohibition, and (now) that there's a clause in the 25th that allows the Cabinet to declare the President unfit - a clause that has never been invoked.</td>\n",

A miscommunication between her partner and her manager had the media reporting her death on January 3, which was soon retracted, but she passed away the following evening.

       "2     Following the Capitol storming, there was talk of removing Trump from power in his last 2 weeks of office. Impeachment needs a House majority and conviction requires a Senate supermajority, but would prevent the President from ever taking office again. The 25th Amendment requires support from the Vice President and a majority of Cabinet officials, but only forces a temporary abdication. Every politician worth his salt is calling for at least one of these, except Biden (in public), who has to be the dutiful mature leader of the sort-of free world already (in public)... We can only assume CNN said \"25th Amendment\" and everyone realized they don't really know which one that is. Well, as soon as you get to the 20s it's hard to remember it all: I know one of them ended Prohibition, and (now) that there's a clause in the 25th that allows the Cabinet to declare the President unfit - a clause that has never been invoked.  \n",

Trump left in the morning; at 2:15 p.m., barricades around the Capitol building were breached by protestors, and Congresspeople were evacuated to a bunker soon after. Protestors were mostly interested in taking photos for social media, and were removed soon after.While only 13 were arrested on the day of the storming, several have been arrested after the fact; this includes a W.V. state delegate that livestreamed the breach, the guy that stole Nancy Pelosi's lectern, and the \"QAnon\" shaman.   \n",

       "2     Following the Capitol storming, there was talk of removing Trump from power in his last 2 weeks of office. Impeachment needs a House majority and conviction requires a Senate supermajority, but would prevent the President from ever taking office again. The 25th Amendment requires support from the Vice President and a majority of Cabinet officials, but only forces a temporary abdication. Every politician worth his salt is calling for at least one of these, except Biden (in public), who has to be the dutiful mature leader of the sort-of free world already (in public)... We can only assume CNN said \"25th Amendment\" and everyone realized they don't really know which one that is. Well, as soon as you get to the 20s it's hard to remember it all: I know one of them ended Prohibition, and (now) that there's a clause in the 25th that allows the Cabinet to declare the President unfit - a clause that has never been invoked.  \n",

We can only assume CNN said \"25th Amendment\" and everyone realized they don't really know which one that is. Well, as soon as you get to the 20s it's hard to remember it all: I know one of them ended Prohibition, and (now) that there's a clause in the 25th that allows the Cabinet to declare the President unfit - a clause that has never been invoked.</td>\n",

There was little fanfare when she was taken to a hospital for breathing problems on December 24. There was much more to talk about when she was reported dead. Then alive. On a cycle for three days. A miscommunication between her partner and her manager had the media reporting her death on January 3, which was soon retracted, but she passed away the following evening. Possibly the first scandal of 2021, it was quickly overshadowed by, well, the entire rest of the week (except on this list, obviously, where politics only starts at #3.)  \n",

       "2     Following the Capitol storming, there was talk of removing Trump from power in his last 2 weeks of office. Impeachment needs a House majority and conviction requires a Senate supermajority, but would prevent the President from ever taking office again. The 25th Amendment requires support from the Vice President and a majority of Cabinet officials, but only forces a temporary abdication. Every politician worth his salt is calling for at least one of these, except Biden (in public), who has to be the dutiful mature leader of the sort-of free world already (in public)... We can only assume CNN said \"25th Amendment\" and everyone realized they don't really know which one that is. Well, as soon as you get to the 20s it's hard to remember it all: I know one of them ended Prohibition, and (now) that there's a clause in the 25th that allows the Cabinet to declare the President unfit - a clause that has never been invoked.  \n",

This is a ceremonial procedure, and elections are rarely decided at this stage. President Trump held a rally outside of Congress on January 6, the day of the certification. Trump left in the morning; at 2:15 p.m., barricades around the Capitol building were breached by protestors, and Congresspeople were evacuated to a bunker soon after. Protestors were mostly interested in taking photos for social media, and were removed soon after.While only 13 were arrested on the day of the storming, several have been arrested after the fact; this includes a W.V. state delegate that livestreamed the breach, the guy that stole Nancy Pelosi's lectern, and the \"QAnon\" shaman.   \n",
